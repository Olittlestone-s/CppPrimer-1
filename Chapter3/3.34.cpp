/*
计算p2与p1的“距离”，并将p1移动到p2的位置
还不如直接写 ‘p1 = p2’ ！！！
  Find the distance between p1 and p2 and add it to p1. Essentially, this code
moves p1 to the position of p2. Provided that both pointers point to memory
locations within the boundaries of the same array (or 1 past the last element)
, the code will always be legal.
